## Outcome/Learning
This was a very good project in which I learnt the use of useEffect and redux state management, After the user registers the courses the redux store state changes and thereby useEffect comes into play and makes the request to backend to store the registered courses in the mongoDB database. This project was a very good project to help me grasp the redux(redux-toolkit) in depth with axios request to send data to the backend and how all that data is to be used/managed on the backend/server side.

## NPM Commands
* `npm i` - installs all the dependencies
* `npm start` - starts the frontend development server on your local machine.
